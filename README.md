### How to run the app on your phone
#### React-Native
* Build the React Native development environment according to this here : https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup. There are two ways to  create a React Native project:
  * Using react-native-cli
  * using Expo-cli

* We use Expo-cli in this project. Because the Expo can run the React-Native app on our phone easily and quickly.
#### Expo
* Sign up an account of Expo here: https://expo.dev/signup.
* Download Expo app on your smartphone and login.

#### Download Source code
* https://github.com/MolinSun/ITCarlowOrientationApp.git 
#### Run
* Open the terminal
* Go to your directory of source code
* Run: expo start
* If the step 3 run successful, there will have a QR code shown on your computer
* Point your phoneâ€™s camera at the QR code. Then the Expo will send notification to you. Click the notification, and then the app will build on your phone.
